# Ookami Research and Consulting Limited

This project will provide an insight to data visualization services offered by Ookami Research and Consulting Limited.
My Project uses publicly available data from https://data.gov.ie and uses crossfilter to slice it and dice it then dc.js and d3.js to visualize it.
 
## UX - TODO
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, 
focusing on who this website is for, 
what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, 
with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. 
that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), 
or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features - TODO

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features - TODO
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, 
although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement - TODO
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, 
and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. 
For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [data.gov.ie](https://data.gov.ie/)
    - The project uses **data.gov.ie** for all data needs, xls,csv and api formats used.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
    - Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. 
    - Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.
- [d3.js](https://d3js.org)
    - D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. 
    - D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. 
    - D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation..
- [Crossfilter](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference)
    - The project uses **Crossfilter** to create dimensions and groups.
- [dc.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js)
    - dc.js is a javascript charting library with native crossfilter support, allowing 
    - highly efficient exploration on large multi-dimensional datasets (inspired by crossfilter's demo). 
    - It leverages d3 to render charts in CSS-friendly SVG format. 
    - Charts rendered using dc.js are data driven and reactive and therefore provide instant feedback to user interaction.

## Testing - TODO

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment - TODO

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
